# FIXME: spam unlearn then learn doesn't seem to work properly
# FIXME: last_replies doesn't get updated if the tweets are already processed
#        (which is almost always)
# FEATURE: if can't post tweet (or do some other operation), pend it
# FEATURE: email digest and escapable entities, waaah (works, but... eww)
# FEATURE: use jinja for email digest? (split into separate module if so)
# FEATURE: click on any username to configure to/from/ban/following options
# FEATURE: HEAD tinyurls etc. to put a title attribute on with final URL
#          or, indeed, expand them fully
# FIXME: assumes UTC coming out of twitter (however this is probably true)
#
# Prereqs (most should work fine via easy_install):
#
# pysqlite
# jinja 2.1.1 or later
# spambayes
